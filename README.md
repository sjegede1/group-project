# Another Weather App

## Description
We built a weather app that shows you the current weather condition in your city; you can search using your zipcode or city.  
We built this app to using 6 React components
- Your current City
- The local time in your city
- An overview of the current weather conditions
  - An image of the weather condition
  - Current Weather, humidity and wind speed
- The forecast on the hour for the next 24 hours.
- The 3-day forecast
- A search bar to change the city or zipcode of the weather data
